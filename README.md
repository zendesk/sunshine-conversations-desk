# SmoochDesk

A sample business system built with Meteor and the Smooch API.

## How do you run this?

1. Install meteor

  `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

2. Clone this thing

  `git clone https://github.com/smooch/smooch-desk.git`

3. In the _smooch-desk_ directory, run `npm install`

4. Configure a webhook:

  Configure a [Smooch webhook](https://app.smooch.io/integrations/webhook) to send "_All Triggers_" to your smoochDesk app at the "/hook" route

5. Configure your secret keys and appToken

  You'll need a managed account secret key which you can obtain from https://app.smooch.io/account. The key ID should have a `act_` prefix.

  Using the _settings.json.example_ file as a guide, create a _settings.json_ file that contains your appToken, secret key, key ID, and appId.

6. Run it:

  `meteor --settings settings.json`

  You can visit "/web-messenger" to send test messages as an end-user

## Based on Meteor Slack

This project's structure and UI is based on work done by [@timbrandin] as part of his [Meteor Slack](https://slides.com/timbrandin/meteor-slack) project. Substantial changes have been made since to repurpose the project for use as a Smooch "business system" example. As such, this code is made available under the GPL.
