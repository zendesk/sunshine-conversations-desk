## Based on Meteor Slack

This project's structure and UI is based on work done by [@timbrandin] as part of his [Meteor Slack](https://slides.com/timbrandin/meteor-slack) project. Substantial changes have been made since to repurpose the project for use as a Smooch "business system" example. As such, this code is made available under the GPL.
